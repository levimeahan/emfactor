Inspired by reselect, the selectors here are to be used by the interface for two primary purposes:

* Answering important logic questions: "Is the user logged in?", "Does the user have manager access?"
* Filtering data, such as a list of employees with a certain shift in their availability, 
or what the user's shifts are for the next week
